We are applying a major API refactoring in this release. The main goal is to make the API more consistent and easier to use. We are also adding new features and improvements. This release is not backward compatible with the previous versions. Please read the following guide to upgrade your project.

## New style bindings

We introduced the new style bindings `vm->bind` in [`v1.1.3`](https://github.com/pocketpy/pocketpy/releases/tag/v1.1.3) and deprecated the old style bindings `vm->bind_func<>` and `vm->bind_method<>`.

In this release, we added an ARGC-based binding `vm->bind_func` (without template parameter)
to replace the old style bindings. If you are still using `vm->bind_func<>` and `vm->bind_method<>`,
please update your code to use `vm->bind_func` instead.

```cpp
// old style (removed)
vm->bind_func<N>(obj, "add", f_add);
vm->bind_method<M>(obj, "get", f_get);

// new ARGC-based binding
vm->bind_func(obj, "add", N, f_add);
vm->bind_func(obj, "get", M+1, f_get);
```

Before starting, please read the [Ideas](./ideas.md) page and choose a project you are interested in.
Set up a C++ compiler, clone pocketpy sources from github and try to build.
This helps you confirm that your skills and experience match the requirements of the project.

Your application should include the following:

1. A brief introduction about yourself, including the most related open sourced project you have worked on before. It is highly recommended to attach your Github profile link.
2. A technical proposal for the project you are interested in working on, including:
    + Your understanding of the project.
    + The technical approach/architecture you will adopt.
    + The challenges you might face and how you will overcome them.
3. A timeline for the project, including the milestones and deliverables.
4. Other information required by the Google Summer of Code program.
